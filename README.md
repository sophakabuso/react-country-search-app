Countries Explorer Web Application

The Countries Explorer Web Application is a user-friendly platform designed to provide information about countries worldwide. Its primary purpose is to allow users to explore and learn more about different countries. Here's an overview of its functionality and the technologies used:

Functionality:

    Country Information Display: The application displays a list of countries with their flags, names, capitals, regions, populations, and more.

    Search Functionality: Users can enter search queries in the search bar to filter and find specific countries based on their names or official names.

    Detailed Country View: Clicking on a country card takes users to a detailed view that provides more information about the selected country, including its flag, capital, region, population, and languages spoken.

    Back to Home: Users can navigate back to the home page from the detailed country view by clicking the "Back to Home" button.

    Error Handling: The application handles errors gracefully and provides clear error messages if any issues arise during data retrieval.

Technologies Used:

    React: The front-end of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive user interfaces. React components are used to structure and manage the application.

    React Router: React Router is used for client-side routing, enabling navigation between the home page and detailed country views.

    CSS Modules: CSS Modules are utilized for styling components, providing a scoped and maintainable approach to styling. The styles module is imported and applied to maintain consistency in styling.

    External API: The app integrates with an external REST API (restcountries.com) to retrieve country data, including flags, names, and other details.

    State Management: React's built-in state management is employed to handle user input, country data, loading states, and error messages. State variables are updated based on user interactions and API responses.

    Asynchronous Data Fetching: Asynchronous data fetching is used to retrieve country data from the external API. The fetch function is employed to make HTTP requests.

    Dynamic UI Updates: The application dynamically updates the user interface based on user search queries and selections, providing a seamless user experience.

    Component-Based Architecture: The application follows a component-based architecture, where different parts of the application (e.g., App, Home, CountryCard, CountryDetail) are organized into modular components. This approach enhances code maintainability and reusability.

Getting Started:

To run the Countries Explorer Web Application locally on your machine, clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the development server. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
